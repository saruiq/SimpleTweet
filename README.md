## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges that I faced with this project is when I was trying to open the RestClientTemplate onto Android Studio, I got an error that would recognized certain methods and I was able to run my emulator. After going to the TA, I realized that I was trying to import the file, when I should have just opened the file. I also had an issue when I was inplementing the timestamp for each tweet, I was following the concept guide provided and I was having a hard time writing the function in Tweet.java to grab the time form the API, but I got help from the slack channel and my tech fellows as well! In general, I still faced issues of my Ardroid Studio program being super slow and glitchy but I was able to finall finish the app!
