## Part 2

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  - [x] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  - [x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  - [x] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
  - [x] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh

- [ ] User can click links in tweets launch the web browser 
- [ ] User can **select "reply" from detail view to respond to a tweet**
- [ ] The "Compose" action is moved to a FloatingActionButton instead of on the AppBar

- [ ] Enable your app to receive implicit intents from other apps. When a link is shared from a web browser, it should pre-fill the text and title of the web page when composing a tweet. 

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I face with this project is alongside the usual issue of Android Studio being glitchy and slow, I had some coding issues where when I ran the program, I wasn't getting certain Toast notifications, but I realized that I forgot to add them. Also, in the beginning of the project, I had an issue where I was trying to make the hardcoded text into a string value reference, but although I was following the correct steps, I couldn't get rid of the warning error. However, after asking a TA on slack to confim this issue, the TA said that it was fine that the warning error was there, as long as the program worked! Overall, I didn't have too many concerning issues for this project and I sucessfully finished the app!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges that I faced with this project is when I was trying to open the RestClientTemplate onto Android Studio, I got an error that would recognized certain methods and I was able to run my emulator. After going to the TA, I realized that I was trying to import the file, when I should have just opened the file. I also had an issue when I was inplementing the timestamp for each tweet, I was following the concept guide provided and I was having a hard time writing the function in Tweet.java to grab the time form the API, but I got help from the slack channel and my tech fellows as well! In general, I still faced issues of my Ardroid Studio program being super slow and glitchy but I was able to finall finish the app!
